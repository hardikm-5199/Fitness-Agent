## Nutrition Advice
To support your fat loss goal, focus on a calorie-deficient diet with a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Aim to eat:

Example:

* Healthy Fats: 35-70 grams (based on 70 kg body weight)

Remember to stay hydrated by drinking at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.
